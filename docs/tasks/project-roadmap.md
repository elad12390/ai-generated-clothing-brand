# Project Roadmap: AI Generated Clothing Brand

## IMPORTANT: MVP-Focused Approach
To ship faster, we're using an MVP-focused approach. The detailed 10-week plan has been moved to [full-roadmap.md](full-roadmap.md) for reference. This document now focuses on our accelerated MVP timeline.

## Current Plan: MVP Roadmap
We're following the MVP roadmap which can be found at [mvp-roadmap.md](mvp-roadmap.md). This focuses on getting a minimal viable product shipped as quickly as possible while maintaining our core product concept.

## Success Criteria for MVP
By the end of our MVP phase, the system should:
- Automatically generate one shirt design per day based on trending topics
- Store shirt designs in a database
- Display shirts on a website
- Upload designs to Printful for print-on-demand fulfillment
- Be fully deployed and operational

## Post-MVP Enhancements
After shipping the MVP, we'll add these features:
- Advanced topic filtering and selection
- QR code generation
- Countdown timer functionality
- Social sharing features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Advanced styling and UX enhancements
- Analytics dashboard
- Mobile application
