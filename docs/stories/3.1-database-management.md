# Story 3.1: Database Management

## Status
InProgress

## Story
As a system, I want to store generated shirts so that I maintain a complete history

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System stores shirt metadata (creation date, topic, design elements) in database
2. System retrieves stored shirts for website display
3. Database schema supports efficient storage and retrieval of shirt data
4. System handles database connection failures gracefully
5. Database operations are performant under expected load

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Design minimal database schema for shirt storage
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database (Supabase)
- [x] Implement basic database connection and models
- [x] Create basic CRUD operations for shirt data
- [ ] Write unit tests for database operations
- [ ] Perform integration testing

## Dev Notes
Based on the full-stack architecture document:
- Database: PostgreSQL (reliable, free tier available)
- Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Run (cheap, scales to zero)
- Database should store complete history of generated shirts
- Must include metadata (creation date, topic, design elements)
- Should enable fast retrieval for frontend display

### Testing
Unit tests for CRUD operations.
Integration tests for database connectivity and data persistence.
