# Story 4.1: Print-on-Demand Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a system, I want to submit designs to print-on-demand suppliers so that physical shirts can be produced

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System integrates with Printful API for product creation
2. System submits generated shirt designs to print-on-demand service
3. System tracks submission status
4. System handles API failures gracefully with retry mechanisms
5. System stays within API rate limits

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Set up Printful account and API access
- [x] Implement basic Printful API integration
- [x] Create basic product creation functionality
- [x] Implement design upload functionality
- [ ] Add status tracking for submitted designs
- [x] Write unit tests for API integration
- [x] Perform integration testing

## Dev Notes
Based on the full-stack architecture document:
- Printful API: Handles product creation and fulfillment
- Printful Storefront: Existing e-commerce solution from print-on-demand provider
- Technology Stack: Python, FastAPI for backend
- Should handle product creation and fulfillment
- No handling of shipping or inventory (handled by Printful)

### Testing
Unit tests for API integration.
Integration tests for the complete submission workflow.
Rate limiting and error handling verification.
